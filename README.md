US COVID-19 7-Day Case Rate per 100,000, by State/Territory
I created a chloropleth map of US COVID-19 7-Day Case Rate per 100,000, by State/Territory. This map shows how COVID-19 has impacted the United States in the past week. It is important to show how even though people are getting vaccinated COVID-19 is not going away and it is still going to affect many people. The article I found is talking about how full immunity is not going to likely occur. The map has interactive states where the user can click on the state and see the number of cases that has occurred in the past week. This map will help a map reader understand which states are high in cases and which states have a lower number. This map will be a useful tool to the New York Times because it will help show that the vaccinations are not going to fully get rid of COVID-19. I think the New York Times editors would really think this is a useful and professional looking map.
